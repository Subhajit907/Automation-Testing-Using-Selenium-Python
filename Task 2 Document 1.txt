Code Breakdown:

Import Libraries:

time: Used for pausing execution for page loading.
selenium: Library for browser automation.
webdriver_manager.chrome: Manages downloading the appropriate Chrome webdriver.
Set Up Chrome Driver:

Creates a Chrome service using the downloaded ChromeDriver path.
Navigate to Login Page:

Opens the Mammoth.io login page for a specific workspace project.
Pauses for 5 seconds to allow page loading.
Maximizes the browser window.
Login:

Finds the username field using XPath and enters the credentials.
Finds the password field using XPath and enters the password.
Clicks the login button using XPath.
Pauses for 5 seconds to allow login processing.
Navigate to Data View:

Clicks on the desired view name element using XPath.
Pauses for 5 seconds to allow page loading.
Open Details Pane (Optional):

The provided code includes commented-out sections for potentially opening a details pane.
If your table is within a details pane, uncomment these lines and update the selectors accordingly.
Count Table Columns:

Defines two XPath selectors to target potential table structures:
table_xpath1: Targets unordered list elements with class list ng-scope.
table_xpath2: Targets elements with class value ng-binding ng-scope.
Finds all matching elements using these selectors.
Calculates the number of columns for each selector and sums them to get the total column count.
Prints the total number of columns in the table.
Close Browser:

Pauses for 10 seconds (optional, for visual verification).
Quits the Selenium webdriver, closing the browser window.
Note:

This script relies on XPath selectors to locate elements on the Mammoth.io website. These selectors may need to be adjusted if the website structure changes.
The script includes login credentials which should be replaced with your actual Mammoth.io credentials.
The script uses two XPath selectors to capture potential table structures. You may need to modify these selectors based on the specific HTML structure of your target table.
Using the Script:

Save the script as a Python file (e.g., mammoth_table_columns.py).
Update the XPath selectors (table_xpath1 and table_xpath2) if necessary to match the structure of your target table.
Replace the username and password placeholders with your Mammoth.io credentials.
Run the script from your terminal: python mammoth_table_columns.py
