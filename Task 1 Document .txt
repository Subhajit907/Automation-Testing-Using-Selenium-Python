Code Breakdown:

1.Import Libraries:

time: Used for pausing execution for page loading.
telnetlib.EC: Not directly used in this code. Potentially a leftover import.
selenium: Library for browser automation.
webdriver_manager.chrome: Manages downloading the appropriate Chrome webdriver.

2.Set Up Chrome Driver:

Creates a Chrome service using the downloaded ChromeDriver path.
Navigate to Login Page:

Opens the Mammoth.io login page for a specific workspace project.
Pauses for 5 seconds to allow page loading.
Maximizes the browser window.

3.
Login:

Finds the username field using XPath and enters the credentials.
Finds the password field using XPath and enters the password.
Clicks the login button using XPath.
Pauses for 5 seconds to allow login processing.
Navigate to Data View:

Clicks on the desired view name element using XPath.
Pauses for 5 seconds to allow page loading.
Open Details Pane:

Finds the element to open the details pane (potentially a specific data point).
Clicks the element to open the details pane.
Pauses for 20 seconds to allow the details pane to load fully.
Switch Window Focus:

Gets the current window handle.
Gets all open window handles.
Iterates through all window handles and switches focus to the newly opened window (details pane) if it's different from the login window.
Extract Data:

Finds the first three data points within the details pane using XPath selectors.
Extracts the text content of each data point and prints it.
Close Browser:

Pauses for 10 seconds (optional, for visual verification).
Quits the Selenium webdriver, closing the browser window.

Note:

This script relies on XPath selectors to locate specific elements on the Mammoth.io website. These selectors may need to be adjusted if the website structure changes.
The script includes login credentials which should be replaced with your actual Mammoth.io credentials.
Using the Script:

Save the script as a Python file (e.g., mammoth_data_extract.py).
Update the XPath selectors if necessary to match the specific data points you want to extract.
Replace the username and password placeholders with your Mammoth.io credentials.
Run the script from your terminal: python mammoth_data_extract.py
This will automate the login process, navigate to the desired data view, open the details pane, and extract the text content of the first three data points.
