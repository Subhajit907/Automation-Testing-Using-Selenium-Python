(Not included in this code snippet, but recommended) Add a time.sleep(10) line for visual verification and then use driver.quit() to close the browser window.
Note:

This script relies on XPath selectors to locate elements on the Mammoth.io website. These selectors may need to be adjusted if the website structure changes.
The script includes login credentials which should be replaced with your actual Mammoth.io credentials.
The script finds eight elements using a specific XPath pattern. You can modify this pattern or use different selectors to target the elements you need.
Using the Script:

Save the script as a Python file (e.g., mammoth_text_extract.py).
Update the XPath selectors if necessary to match the specific elements you want to extract text from.
Replace the username and password placeholders with your Mammoth.io credentials.
Run the script from your terminal: python mammoth_text_extract.py
